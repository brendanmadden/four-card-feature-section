## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

- I continued to learn and practice using BEM while working on this project and preparing for it
- I learned a lot more about responsive grid and flexbox layouts in preparation for and while working on this project
- I used a mobile-first workflow on this one, and I feel like I'm getting a better handle on this method

### Continued development

- Responsive layouts are still one of my top priorities. I want to find the most effective, efficient, elegant layouts to use that just seem to WORK
- I would like to continue to improve my HTML and project accessibility
- More advanced HTML and CSS concepts, organization, and layouts

### Useful resources

- [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/) - The BEM docs helped me to understand how and why BEM is used. I really like it so far for organizing and structuring my CSS a little bit better.
- [Guide to Modern CSS Layouts](https://1linelayouts.glitch.me/) - This is an amazing resource on CSS Layouts with Flex and Grid.
